-- PROJECT: Brazilian E-commerce SQL Analysis
-- SCRIPT: 02_delivery_impact_analysis.sql
-- DESCRIPTION: This script analyzes the impact of shipping delays on customer satisfaction.
--              It calculates the difference between estimated and actual delivery dates
--              and correlates these delays with customer review scores.
-- BUSINESS QUESTION:
--    - How much do shipping delays affect customer review scores?
-- METHODOLOGY:
--    1.  [CTE: time_diff]: Calculates the shipping delay in days for each delivered order.
--    2.  [CTE: delay_segments]: Categorizes each order into segments ('On Time or Early',
--        'Slightly Late', 'Very Late') based on the delay.
--    3.  The final query joins with the reviews table and calculates the average review score
--        for each delay segment, proving the relationship between timeliness and satisfaction.
